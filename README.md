# Movie Rating Prediction Using Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes Custom Made Algorithm is used. <br>
In this Movie Rating Prediction I will be using Reviews along with their labels in csv format to train.<br>
## Dataset Cleaning
For all the strings of review we will do:
- Tokenization using RegExpTokenizer
- Stemming using Porter Stemmer
- Stop Words Removal
- Label Encoding
## Training and Evaluating
- For training We are using Naive Bayes
- Algorithm is generated from scratch
- Prediction function is also made separately
## Important
- Please replace Train.csv in Datasets/Train with the file available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LQ0w4_O66r2SAxi4xk0LbtMuqlguN40b/view?usp=sharing
